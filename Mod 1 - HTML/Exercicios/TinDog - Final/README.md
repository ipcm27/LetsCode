The first project, Evil gates, was amde just using HTML and a little bit of CSS. 

The second one, TinDog, was made using html, css, a little bit of JS ( just to the carrousel and to the icons) and Boostratp. It was made in 17 hours and 32 minutes. The mos fun part was to discover how to use flexbox propelly. I wish i could make the project more organized, but I guess that this will come with time doing new projects and reading good code. At this time, I am already in page 45 of Clean code, by uncle Bob.
